Create a comprehensive premium e-commerce platform for a website named "TryneX" with the following specifications, ensuring all files are generated for download and compatible with Netlify frontend deployment and Render free-tier backend with Supabase integration:

- Design: Ultra-modern, dynamic, and premium impression with a clean layout, reflecting July 2025 trends as of 10:55 PM +06, Friday, July 18, 2025, optimized for perfect responsiveness across all screen sizes with precise breakpoints (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px) to ensure proper product card layout and button sizing, preventing issues like auto-opening navbars on smaller screens.
- Files: Generate static frontend files including index.html, styles.css, script.js, products.html, blog.html, products.json, categories.json, and a guidance.txt file with deployment instructions, organized in the root directory for Netlify deployment. Include a backend folder with Node.js files (e.g., server.js) for Render deployment, using the following environment variables: NODE_ENV=production, PORT=10000, SUPABASE_URL=https://wifsqonbnfmwtqvupqbk.supabase.co, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6IndpZnNxb25ibmZtd3RxdnVwcWJrIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTE1ODAyNjMsImV4cCI6MjA2NzE1NjI2M30.A7o3vhEaNZb9lmViHA_KQrwzKJTBWpsD6KbHqkkput0, SERVICE_ROLE=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6IndpZnNxb25ibmZtd3RxdnVwcWJrIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTU4MDI2MywiZXhwIjoyMDY3MTU2MjYzfQ.YUykSOXBGnB3WwuoNm7DQydaEOhFJ7ux2G8jPlJCHjc. Ensure minified CSS/JS, lazy-loaded images, and clean, well-formed JSON structures (products.json with 50+ items, categories.json with 11 categories) for download. Provide a ZIP file or folder structure ready for upload to Netlify and Render.
- Backend: Develop a Node.js backend for Render free-tier, integrating Supabase for database management (e.g., products, orders, users). Use the provided environment variables in a .env file (NODE_ENV=production, PORT=10000, SUPABASE_URL=https://wifsqonbnfmwtqvupqbk.supabase.co, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6IndpZnNxb25ibmZtd3RxdnVwcWJrIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTE1ODAyNjMsImV4cCI6MjA2NzE1NjI2M30.A7o3vhEaNZb9lmViHA_KQrwzKJTBWpsD6KbHqkkput0, SERVICE_ROLE=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6IndpZnNxb25ibmZtd3RxdnVwcWJrIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTU4MDI2MywiZXhwIjoyMDY3MTU2MjYzfQ.YUykSOXBGnB3WwuoNm7DQydaEOhFJ7ux2G8jPlJCHjc) to connect to Supabase. Implement API endpoints for order processing, user authentication, and product management, with error handling to prevent undefined functions.
- Theme: Use a golden (#d4af37), white, and black color scheme applied dynamically with gradients, hover effects, subtle 3D transitions, and advanced animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in, parallax, 3D tilt effects) for a premium feel across all devices.
- Content: Include a complete product catalog with 50+ items across 11 categories, with detailed information for Facebook catalog ads, featuring realistic images and descriptions (use https://via.placeholder.com/300x300?text=Product+Name if real images are unavailable), stored in products.json and synced with Supabase. Categories are managed via categories.json, both editable via the backend:

- Deployment:

Download the generated ZIP, extract to a local folder. 2. Initialize a Git repository: git init, git add ., git commit -m 'Initial TryneX frontend'. 3. Push to a GitHub repository (e.g., tryneX-frontend): git remote add origin <GitHub-URL>, git push -u origin main. 4. Deploy to Netlify: Log into netlify.com, create a new site from Git, select your repository, set Branch: main, Base directory: /, Build command: (blank), Publish directory: /, and deploy."
  - **Backend (Render)**: Optimize for Render free-tier deployment with the backend folder. Include a guidance.txt file with instructions: "1. Download the generated ZIP, extract the backend folder. 2. Create a new Render web service, connect your GitHub repository (e.g., tryneX-backend). 3. Set environment variables in Render: NODE_ENV=production, PORT=10000, SUPABASE_URL=https://wifsqonbnfmwtqvupqbk.supabase.co, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6IndpZnNxb25ibmZtd3RxdnVwcWJrIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTE1ODAyNjMsImV4cCI6MjA2NzE1NjI2M30.A7o3vhEaNZb9lmViHA_KQrwzKJTBWpsD6KbHqkkput0, SERVICE_ROLE=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6IndpZnNxb25ibmZtd3RxdnVwcWJrIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTU4MDI2MywiZXhwIjoyMDY3MTU2MjYzfQ.YUykSOXBGnB3WwuoNm7DQydaEOhFJ7ux2G8jPlJCHjc. 4. Deploy the service and note the backend URL for frontend API integration."
- Final Checks: Verify all features (cart with WhatsApp, Email, Direct order methods, search, tracking, promo codes, banners, order management, wishlist, reviews, etc.) work seamlessly, integrate with the backend via Supabase, and allow order status updates. Test responsiveness, performance, multi-language support, and error handling (resolved JavaScript errors), then push updated directories to GitHub for Netlify and Render deployment.
